Getting started:
  * After installing the tomcat6 package, the server should be accessible
    at http://localhost:8080/
  * If you install tomcat6-admin, then you need to edit 
    /etc/tomcat6/tomcat-users.xml and add to it the following:
      <role rolename="manager"/>
      <user username="tomcat" password="s3cret" roles="manager"/>
    Tomcat administration will be accessible on 
    http://localhost:8080/manager/html
  * Tomcat is not running under a Java security manager by default. If you
    expose your Tomcat instance to the internet, please consider editing
    your /etc/default/tomcat6 file and set TOMCAT6_SECURITY="yes", then
    adjust policy files in /etc/tomcat6/policy.d/ as explained in
    http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/security-manager-howto.html
  * To run more than one Tomcat instance on your server, install the package
    tomcat6-user and run the tomcat6-instance-create utility.
    You should remove the tomcat6 package if you don't want Tomcat to
    start as a daemon at boot time.
  * If you configure your Tomcat to listen on one
    or more privileged ports (such as port 80 or port 443), then you
    may now enable authbind in your /etc/default/tomcat6 file.  The
    authbind package can allow your Tomcat JVM user (a non-root user)
    to listen on privileged ports.  Set AUTHBIND="yes" to enable it,
    and then configure your Tomcat to listen on any port number you
    wish.  See the "man authbind" for information on configuring
    authbind.

NEWS:

tomcat6 (6.0.20-dfsg1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * The tomcat6 package no longer uses the jsvc native service runner.
    Instead, by default, the init script invokes the catalina.sh
    script, and Tomcat does not attempt to open any server sockets on
    ports below 1024.  If you configure your Tomcat to listen on one
    or more privileged ports (such as port 80 or port 443), then you
    may now enable authbind in your /etc/default/tomcat6 file.  The
    authbind package can allow your Tomcat JVM user (a non-root user)
    to listen on privileged ports.  Set AUTHBIND="yes" to enable it,
    and then configure your Tomcat to listen on any port number you
    wish.  See the "man authbind" for information on configuring
    authbind.
  * The Tomcat security manager is now disabled by default.  Previous
    versions of this package enabled the Tomcat security manager by
    default.  A large number of users reported exceptions where the
    root cause was that the security manager was enabled by default.
    In nearly all of these cases, the users are unfamiliar with the
    Java security manager, and are not interested in trying to define
    security manager rules for their webapps -- they just want it to
    run.  Disabling the security manager fixes it for them.  Today,
    most Tomcat users run Tomcat with the security manager disabled.
    Those who intentionally enable it are the minority, and they tend
    to know how it works.  If you are currently using the security
    manager, and would like to continue using it after upgrading to
    tomcat6-6.0.20-10 or higher, edit your /etc/default/tomcat6 file
    and set TOMCAT6_SECURITY="yes".

Differences introduced in the tomcat6-6.0.20-5 release:
- New folders have been created in /var/lib/tomcat6 to allow an administrator to
  add shared classes or libraries. The layout is as follow:
   /var/lib/tomcat6/common - put there jar files to be loaded by the common classloader
   /var/lib/tomcat6/common/classes - put there classes to be loaded by the common classloader
   /var/lib/tomcat6/server - put there jar files to be loaded by the server classloader
   /var/lib/tomcat6/server/classes - put there classes to be loaded by the server classloader
   /var/lib/tomcat6/shared - put there jar files to be loaded by the shared classloader
   /var/lib/tomcat6/shared/classes - put there classes to be loaded by the shared classloader

Differences introduced in the tomcat6-6.0.18-0ubuntu4 release:

- The default JVM temporary directory (java.io.tmpdir), which originally was
  located in /var/lib/tomcat6/temp, was moved to /tmp/tomcat6-temp. You can
  change its location by editing the JVM_TMP setting in /etc/default/tomcat6.
  This directory will get purged every time Tomcat starts (or stops). The
  default security policy was modified to allow webapps to use that directory
  for temporary file creation.

Main differences with the Tomcat 5.5 packages:

- These packages conform to the CATALINA_BASE spec described in RUNNING.txt,
  in order to be able to run multiple instances of Tomcat on the same
  machine.
- The tomcat6 package installs the system instance and init scripts with
  CATALINA_BASE in /var/lib/tomcat6. It installs a minimal ROOT webapp to
  check that everything works correctly.
- A new tomcat6-user package has been created. This package allows users to
  create their own user instance of tomcat (CATALINA_BASE) by calling the
  create-user-tomcat.sh script located in /usr/share/tomcat6/bin. It does not
  require to install the system instance (tomcat6 package).
- The new package tomcat6-common contains files common to tomcat6-user and
  tomcat6. It implements the common CATALINA_HOME in /usr/share/tomcat6.
- The docs (and associated webapp) have been put in a separate tomcat6-docs
  package.
- The -webapps package has been replaced by a tomcat6-examples package that
  just contains the examples webapp.
- The catalina.policy file for the system instance is now autogenerated in
  /var/cache/tomcat6.
