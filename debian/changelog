tomcat8 (8.0.14-1+deb8u2) jessie-security; urgency=high

  * Team upload.

  [ Emmanuel Bourg ]
  * Fix CVE-2016-3092: Denial-of-Service vulnerability with file uploads

  [ Markus Koschany ]
  * Fix CVE-2015-5174:
    Directory traversal vulnerability in RequestUtil.java allows remote
    authenticated users to bypass intended SecurityManager restrictions and
    list a parent directory via a /.. (slash dot dot) in a pathname used by a
    web application in a getResource, getResourceAsStream, or getResourcePaths
    call, as demonstrated by the $CATALINA_BASE/webapps directory.
  * Fix CVE-2015-5345:
    The Mapper component in Apache Tomcat processes redirects before
    considering security constraints and Filters, which allows remote attackers
    to determine the existence of a directory via a URL that lacks a trailing /
    (slash) character.
  * Fix CVE-2015-5346:
    Session fixation vulnerability in Apache Tomcat when different session
    settings are used for deployments of multiple versions of the same web
    application, might allow remote attackers to hijack web sessions by
    leveraging use of a requestedSessionSSL field for an unintended request,
    related to CoyoteAdapter.java and Request.java.
  * Fix CVE-2015-5351:
    The Manager and Host Manager applications in Apache Tomcat establish
    sessions and send CSRF tokens for arbitrary new requests, which allows
    remote attackers to bypass a CSRF protection mechanism by using a token.
  * Fix CVE-2016-0706:
    Apache Tomcat does not place
    org.apache.catalina.manager.StatusManagerServlet on the
    org/apache/catalina/core/RestrictedServlets.properties list, which allows
    remote authenticated users to bypass intended SecurityManager restrictions
    and read arbitrary HTTP requests, and consequently discover session ID
    values, via a crafted web application.
  * Fix CVE-2016-0714:
    The session-persistence implementation in Apache Tomcat mishandles session
    attributes, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended
    SecurityManager restrictions and execute arbitrary code in a privileged
    context via a web application that places a crafted object in a session.
  * Fix CVE-2016-0763:
    The setGlobalContext method in
    org/apache/naming/factory/ResourceLinkFactory.java in Apache Tomcat does
    not consider whether ResourceLinkFactory.setGlobalContext callers are
    authorized, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended
    SecurityManager restrictions and read or write to arbitrary application
    data, or cause a denial of service (application disruption), via a web
    application that sets a crafted global context.

tomcat8 (8.0.14-1+deb8u1) jessie-security; urgency=medium

  * Fixed CVE-2014-7810: Malicious web applications could use expression
    language to bypass the protections of a Security Manager as expressions
    were evaluated within a privileged code section.

tomcat8 (8.0.12-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release
    - Refreshed the patches
  * Fixed the tomcat8-examples configuration (Closes: #753372)
  * No longer create the common/server/shared directories under
    /var/lib/tomcat8, and use a unique lib directory as documented
    upstream since Tomcat 6. The old directories are still supported
    if inherited from a previous installation (Closes: #754386)
  * Depend on libecj-java >= 3.10.0 to support the new Java 8 syntax in JSPs
  * Install the missing tomcat-dbcp.jar in libtomcat8-java and use it as
    the default JDBC pool implementation instead of Commons DBCP.
  * Removed the obsolete patch 0012-java7-compat.patch
  * Tightened the build dependency on junit4 (>= 4.11)
  * Build the Javadoc with the JDK specified by the JAVA_HOME variable
    instead of the default JDK (this fixes a build failure when backporting
    to Wheezy)
  * Removed the note about the authbind IPv6 incompatibility
    in /etc/defaults/tomcat8

    - Switched to Java 7
    - Updated the watch file to match the Tomcat 8 releases
    - Refreshed the patches
    - Updated debian/copyright, documented the xsd files licensed under the CDDL
    - Installed the new jars (spdy, jni, websocket, websocket-api, storeconfig)
    - Updated the artifactId of the specification jars to include
      the new javax prefix
    - Added the javax.websocket-api artifact to libservlet3.1-java
    - New build dependency on cglib, easymock and objenesis
  * Added a patch to include the name of the distribution on the error pages
  * Use XZ compression for the upstream tarball
  * debian/control:
    - Replaced Sun Microsystems with Oracle in the packages descriptions
    - Mentioned 'Apache Tomcat' in the packages descriptions
    - Standards-Version updated to 3.9.5 (no changes)
  * Deploy the Tomcat artifacts in the Maven repository with the 8.x version
    instead of 'debian' to avoid conflicts with other versions of Tomcat.
  * Hard coded the versions in the poms in debian/javaxpoms to fix the version
    of the dependencies for jsp-api
  * Renamed the jars in /usr/share/java to tomcat8-xxx to avoid conflicts
    with other versions of Tomcat
  * Added the missing descriptions to the patches
  * Added a patch to ignore the failing tests
  * Moved the tomcat-{servlet|jsp|el}-api artifacts from libservlet3.1-java
    to libtomcat8-java and changed their versions to the Tomcat version instead
    of the specification version.
  * Removed libservlet3.1-java.links defining the tomcat-* links
    in /usr/share/java with the specifications versions
  * The symlinks to /usr/share/tomcat8/lib are no longer split between the two
    packages libtomcat8-java and tomcat8-common. tomcat8-common assembles all
    the jars required by Tomcat (tomcat jars + dbcp + pool). libtomcat8-java
    deploys only the jars in /usr/share/java and the Maven artifacts in
    /usr/share/maven-repo.
  * Added the EL and WebSocket APIs to libservlet3.1-java-doc
  * Added a Lintian override for the incompatible-java-bytecode-format warning
    since Tomcat requires Java 7
  * Added a Lintian override to clear the codeless-jar warnings
    on the tomcat-i18n jars instead of a patch turning them into zip files.
  * Removed 0011-fix-classpath-lintian-warnings.patch and specified
    the classpath of jasper.jar in libtomcat8-java.manifest instead.
  
  [ tony mancill ]
  * Include tomcat-util-scan.jar in the libtomcat8-java package.
  * Remove debian/NEWS (inapplicable to this release).
  * Prune debian/changelog to only contain tomcat8 entries.
