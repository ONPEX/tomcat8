tomcat8 (8.0.3-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Emmanuel Bourg ]
  * Team upload.
  * New upstream release (Closes: #722675)
    - Updated the version of the Servlet, JSP and EL APIs
    - Switched to Java 7
    - Updated the watch file to match the Tomcat 8 releases
    - Refreshed the patches
    - Updated debian/copyright, documented the xsd files licensed under the CDDL
    - Installed the new jars (spdy, jni, websocket, websocket-api, storeconfig)
    - Updated the artifactId of the specification jars to include
      the new javax prefix
    - Added the javax.websocket-api artifact to libservlet3.1-java
    - New build dependency on cglib, easymock and objenesis
  * Added a patch to include the name of the distribution on the error pages
  * Use XZ compression for the upstream tarball
  * debian/control:
    - Replaced Sun Microsystems with Oracle in the packages descriptions
    - Mentioned 'Apache Tomcat' in the packages descriptions
    - Standards-Version updated to 3.9.5 (no changes)
  * Deploy the Tomcat artifacts in the Maven repository with the 8.x version
    instead of 'debian' to avoid conflicts with other versions of Tomcat.
  * Hard coded the versions in the poms in debian/javaxpoms to fix the version
    of the dependencies for jsp-api
  * Renamed the jars in /usr/share/java to tomcat8-xxx to avoid conflicts
    with other versions of Tomcat
  * Added the missing descriptions to the patches
  * Added a patch to ignore the failing tests
  * Moved the tomcat-{servlet|jsp|el}-api artifacts from libservlet3.1-java
    to libtomcat8-java and changed their versions to the Tomcat version instead
    of the specification version.
  * Removed libservlet3.1-java.links defining the tomcat-* links
    in /usr/share/java with the specifications versions
  * The symlinks to /usr/share/tomcat8/lib are no longer split between the two
    packages libtomcat8-java and tomcat8-common. tomcat8-common assembles all
    the jars required by Tomcat (tomcat jars + dbcp + pool). libtomcat8-java
    deploys only the jars in /usr/share/java and the Maven artifacts in
    /usr/share/maven-repo.
  * Added the EL and WebSocket APIs to libservlet3.1-java-doc
  * Added a Lintian override for the incompatible-java-bytecode-format warning
    since Tomcat requires Java 7
  * Added a Lintian override to clear the codeless-jar warnings
    on the tomcat-i18n jars instead of a patch turning them into zip files.
  * Removed 0011-fix-classpath-lintian-warnings.patch and specified
    the classpath of jasper.jar in libtomcat8-java.manifest instead.
  
  [ tony mancill ]
  * Include tomcat-util-scan.jar in the libtomcat8-java package.
  * Remove debian/NEWS (inapplicable to this release).
  * Prune debian/changelog to only contain tomcat8 entries.
